If you select a mine first, generate a new game
You win when only mines are left unselected. They don't have to be flagged.
You shouldn't be able to flag a cell after it's been clicked.
When the timer increases from 9 to 10, the "number of mines" label shouldn't move. Maybe I should create a new class for the timer and mine counter and set their size to be fixed.
When you select a cell with no mines adjacent, it should automatically show the value of the surrounding cells.

Fill in the GUIGrid class - it should contain the code that is currently in GUITop.
Update GUITop so that it contains a GUIGrid object and empty padding so that its size is consistent.

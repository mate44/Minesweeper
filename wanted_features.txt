If you select a mine first, generate a new game with the mine that was selected as the mine selected
You win when only mines are left unselected. They don't have to be flagged.
You shouldn't be able to flag a cell after it's been clicked.
When you select a cell with no mines adjacent, it should automatically show the value of the surrounding cells.

Once you win/lose, stop the timer
GUITop and GUIBottom overlap in their area - idea: remove GUIGrid and it's surrounding squares. Replace with an empty space of the same size.
